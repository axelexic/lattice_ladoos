    "## Search $\\leq$ Decision for vanilla LWE\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing the search-to-decision reduction for Ring-LWE, it's useful to do the search-to-decision reduction for plain LWE. Let $\\mathbf{s} \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^m$ be a secret chosen uniformly at random. In LWE, one is given multiple samples of the form $\\Gamma_i := (\\mathbf{a}_i, \\langle\\mathbf{a}_i,\\mathbf{s}\\rangle + e_i)$ where $\\mathbf{a}_i \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^m$ is drawn uniformly at random, and $e_i \\in  \\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$ is drawn from some discrete univariate distribution $\\chi$ over a subset of \"small\" elements in $\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$. Also consider another set of similar looking samples $\\Theta_i := (\\mathbf{u}_i, v_i)$, where $\\mathbf{u}_i \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^m$ and $v_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$ are chosen uniformly at random \n",
    "\n",
    "The **decisional-LWE** problem asks to distinguish $\\left \\{\\Gamma_1, \\Gamma_2, \\cdots, \\Gamma_n \\right \\}$ from $\\left \\{\\Theta_1, \\Theta_2, \\cdots, \\Theta_{n'} \\right \\}$ with non-negligible probability.\n",

    "The **search-LWE** problem asks to find $\\mathbf{s}$ with high probability, given $\\left \\{\\Gamma_1, \\Gamma_2, \\cdots, \\Gamma_n \\right \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup for search to decision reduction is as follows: An oracle $\\mathcal{D}$ that can distinguish between $\\left \\{ \\Gamma_i \\right \\}$ and $\\left \\{\\Theta_i \\right \\}$ is given. Input to $\\mathcal{D}$ are numbers of the form $(\\mathbf{a}, x) \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}^m, \\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})$ where $\\mathbf{a}$ is guaranteed to be uniformly random and\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol  style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha\">\n",
    "  <li> $\\mathcal{D}$ outputs $1$ if $x = \\langle \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{s}\\rangle + e$ for some $\\mathbf{s}$ and $e \\leftarrow \\chi$, otherwise</li>\n",
    "  <li>$\\mathcal{D}$ outputs $0$ if $x$ is uniformly distributed</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "For **any other distribution** of $\\mathbf{a}$ or $x$, the oracle $\\mathcal{D}$ makes no promises about its output---not even the promise that $\\mathcal{D}$ will terminate (i.e., not get in an infinite loop)! For any reduction that uses $\\mathcal{D}$ as a subroutine, the caller must prove that inputs to $\\mathcal{D}$ are either of the type (a) or (b). Otherwise, the reduction will be invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the search-LWE problem, we need to come up with an algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ that _somehow_ uses $\\mathcal{D}$ to find the secret $\\mathbf{s}$. Input to the search algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ is guaranteed to be a list of valid LWE samples $\\Gamma_i$ computed from the same secret $\\mathbf{s}$, and $\\mathcal{A}$ is expected to return $\\mathbf{s}$ as its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Digression**: You might object that in the definition of both search and decisional LWE, $\\mathbf{s}$ was assumed to be chosen uniformly at random, but in setup above no such assumption was made. It turns out, Decisional-LWE is random-self-reducible (RSR)! That is, if there's an oracle $\\mathcal{D}$ that can distinguish $\\{\\Gamma_i\\}$ from $\\{\\Theta_i\\}$ on an average (i.e., $\\mathbf{s}$ chosen uniformly at random), then there's an algorithm $\\mathcal{D}'$, that can distinguish $\\{\\Gamma_i^{\\mathsf{WC}}\\}$ from $\\{\\Theta_i\\}$, where $\\Gamma_i^{\\mathsf{WC}}$ are worst-case LWE samples generated from $\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathsf{WC}}$. Because of this, no assumption on LWE samples are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof (Decisional-LWE is Random Self Reducible)\n",
    "Basically, the algorithm $\\mathcal{D}'$ on worst case input $(\\mathbf{a}, x)$---where $x$ is either uniformly random or $\\langle\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathsf{WC}} \\rangle + e$---generates a random $\\mathbf{s} \\leftarrow (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^m$ and creates a new LWE sample  $(\\mathbf{a}, x + \\langle\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{s}\\rangle)$ and feeds it to the average case decision oracle $\\mathcal{D}$. It then uses the output of $\\mathcal{D}$ as its own ouput. Note that if $x$ was chosen uniformly at random, and assuming $q$ is prime,  $x + \\langle\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{s}\\rangle$ is also distributed uniformly at random. On the other hand, if $ x = \\langle\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{s}^{\\mathsf{WC}} \\rangle + e$, then \n",

    "but $\\mathbf{s}^{\\mathsf{WC}} + \\mathbf{s}$ is distributed uniformly at random since $\\mathbf{s}$ is (because $q$ is prime).

    "### The Search to Decision Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{s} = \\{\\psi_1, \\psi_2,\\cdots,\\psi_m\\}$, where $\\psi_i$s are unknown at the start of the reduction.  Let $\\{(\\mathbf{a}_i, x_i)\\}_{i \\in [1,\\cdots,n]}$ be the input to search algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$. To simplify notation, let $\\mathbf{A} := \\begin{pmatrix}\\mathbf{a}_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{a}_n \\end{pmatrix} \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^{n\\times m}$, $\\mathbf{e} := \\begin{pmatrix}e_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ e_n \\end{pmatrix} \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^{n}$ and $\\mathbf{b} := \\begin{pmatrix}{x}_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n \\end{pmatrix}$. (In this notation, input to $\\mathcal{A}$ is $(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{b})$ satisfying $\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{s} + \\mathbf{e} = \\mathbf{b}$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of this reduction is to guess the value of $\\psi_i$ for each coordinate one at a time and create a _new set of_ of LWE samples  $(\\mathbf{A}', \\mathbf{b}')$ from $(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{b})$ such that \n",
    "\n",
    "1. when our guess for $\\psi_i$ is correct, $(\\mathbf{A}', \\mathbf{b}')$ has the same distribution as a normal LWE sample, and \n",
    "2. when our guess is incorrect, then $(\\mathbf{A}', \\mathbf{b}')$ has uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming, we can create such an $\\mathbf{A}'$ and $\\mathbf{b}'$, then finding $\\psi_i$ just requires $O(m)$ calls to the decision oracle $\\mathcal{D}$ with $(\\mathbf{A}', \\mathbf{b}')$ as its input. The algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ can then output those values of $\\psi_i$ for which $\\mathcal{D}$ has returned 1 (i.e., it's an LWE sample).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to construct $(\\mathbf{A}', \\mathbf{b}')$ from $(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{b})$:  Suppose we are trying to guess the $i$-th coordinate of $\\mathbf{s}$. Let's say our guess for the $i$-th coordinate is $\\psi_i$. To construct $(\\mathbf{A}', \\mathbf{b}')$, sample $\\mathbf{c}_i := [c_{1i}, c_{2i},\\cdots,c_{ni}] \\leftarrow (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^n$ uniformly at random, and construct a matrix $\\mathbf{C}_i$ whose $i$-th column is $\\mathbf{c}$ and every other column is $\\mathbf{0}^n$, i.e.,\n",

    "\n",
    "**Claim-1**: If the guess for $\\psi_i$ is correct, then $(\\mathbf{A}', \\mathbf{e}')$ is distributed like an LWE sample with the same secret $\\mathbf{s}$.\n",

    "## Ring-LWE Search $\\leq$ Ring-LWE Decision \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup for search to decision reduction for Ring-LWE is as follows: One is given polynomially many samples of the form $\\Gamma_i := (a_i, b_i) \\in \\mathcal{O}_q\\times \\mathcal{O}_q$ where $b_i(X)$ is known to be of form $a_i(X)\\cdot s(X) + e_i(X)$. In addition, one has oracle access to a distingusher $\\mathcal{D}$ that can distinguish between $\\left \\{ \\Gamma_i \\right \\}$ and $\\left \\{\\Theta_i \\right \\}$, where $\\Theta_i$ is uniformly distributed over $\\mathcal{O}_q\\times \\mathcal{O}_q$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Input to $\\mathcal{D}$ are polynomial pairs $(a, b)$ where $a(X)$ is guaranteed to be uniformly random over $\\mathcal{O}_q$, and\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol  style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha\">\n",
    "  <li> $\\mathcal{D}$ outputs $1$ if $b(X) = a(X)\\cdot s(X) + e(X)$ for some $s(X)$ and $e(X) \\leftarrow \\chi$, otherwise</li>\n",
    "  <li>$\\mathcal{D}$ outputs $0$ if $b(X)$ is uniformly distributed over $\\mathcal{O}_q$</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "For **any other distribution** of $a(X)$ or $b(X)$, the oracle $\\mathcal{D}$ makes no promises about its output---not even the promise that $\\mathcal{D}$ will terminate! For any reduction that uses $\\mathcal{D}$ as a subroutine, the caller must prove that input to $\\mathcal{D}$ is either of the type (a) or (b).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of search Ring-LWE reduction is to come up with an algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ that makes polynomially many calls to $\\mathcal{D}$ to find $s(X)$. Note that input to $\\mathcal{A}$ are always valid Ring-LWE samples. If $\\mathcal{A}$ is fed with anything else, $\\mathcal{A}$ is not required to even terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why can't we use the vanilla LWE reduction for Ring-LWE? In LWE, we had a single value of $b_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}$ per-sample that allowed us to guess each coordinate of the secret $\\mathbf{s}$ one at a time. In case of Ring-LWE, we have $n$ coefficients of the polynomial per $b_i(x)$, so we need to guess all the $n$ coefficients of $s(X)$ simulatenoulsy, which the LWE reduction cannot handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the reduction works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, instead of working with polynomial representation of $b(X)$, we convert it to CRT representation $\\mathbf{\\hat{b}} = [\\hat{b}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{b}_n] \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^n$. (Recall, $n = \\phi(m)$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then create $n+1$ hybrid samples $\\mathbf{\\hat{h}}_i$, $i = 0,1,\\cdots,n$, such that the first $i$ CRT terms of $\\mathbf{\\hat{h}}_i$ are uniformly random, but the rest are same as $\\mathbf{\\hat{b}}$. One way to generate this is to compute $\\mathbf{\\hat{h}}_i = \\mathbf{\\hat{b}} + [u_1,\\cdots,u_{i},0,\\cdots,0]$ where $u_1, u_2, \\cdots, u_{i}$'s are chosen uniformly at random from $(\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})$. In this notation, $\\mathbf{\\hat{h}}_0 = \\mathbf{\\hat{b}}$, and $\\mathbf{\\hat{h}}_{n}$ is uniformly random. From the CRT representation of $\\mathbf{\\hat{h}}_i$'s, Ring-LWE style polynomial pairs $(a(X), h_i(X))$. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Assuming the distinguisher $\\mathcal{D}$ has advantage $\\epsilon$, a simple hybrid argument shows that there exists an index $k \\in [0,\\cdots,n],$ such that on input $(a, h_{k-1})$, $\\mathcal{D}$ outputs 1 (i.e, Ring-LWE sample), while on input $(a, h_{k})$, it outputs 0 (i.e., uniformly random). The distinguishing advantage of $\\mathcal{D}$ for such inputs is $\\epsilon/n$. One can sequentially run $\\mathcal{D}$ with $h_i$'s as input and find $k$ by making at max $n+1$ calls to $\\mathcal{D}$.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "An important point to note here is that $\\mathcal{D}$ always takes input in polynomial representation, but $h_i(X)$ was generated from its CRT representation $\\mathbf{\\hat{h}}_i$. So why should polynomials generated from hybrid samples in CRT representation not behave more erratically? Answer: CRT representation is in a bijective relationship with polynomial representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once we know the value of $k$ as above, we will create a search algorithm $\\mathcal{A}_k$ that will guess the $k$-th CRT coefficient corresponding to $s(X)$. This step is very similar to vanilla LWE reduction, where we randomly guess the $k$-th CRT value of $s(X)$, and let $\\mathcal{D}$ tell us if our guess is correct. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In more detail, let the CRT representation of $s(X)$ be $\\mathbf{\\hat{s}} = [\\hat{s}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{s}_n]$. Algorithm $\\mathcal{A}_k$, will then find $\\hat{s}_k$. To do this, $\\mathcal{A}_k$ first samples two vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ such that the first $k-1$ entries of $\\mathbf{u}$ are uniformly random and the rest are zero, while $\\mathbf{v}$ has all zeros except for a random value in $k$-th location:\n",

    "4. So far we have only been able to compute a single CRT value of $s(X)$. As we have seen before, each $\\tau_j$ permutes the elements of CRT representation, so if we systematically permute the elements of $(\\mathbf{\\hat{a}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{b}})$ and run step-3 for each $\\tau_j$, we will recover all the $\\hat{s}_i$. For this to work, however, we need guarantees about the distribution of $a(X)$ and $b(X)$.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "Let $u$ be any primitve $m$-th root  of unity in $(\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})$. For any polynomial $f(X)$, fix the CRT representation $\\mathbf{\\hat{f}} := [f(u^{e_1}),f(u^{e_2}),\\cdots,f(u^{e_n})]$, where $e_i$s are integers coprime to $m$. (Essentially we are fixing which coordinates come from which power of $u$.)\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "**Claim**: Let $\\Gamma_{e_j} := (\\tau_{e_j}(a), \\tau_{e_j}(b))$. Then $\\Gamma_{e_j}$ is a valid Ring-LWE sample which is distributed identially as $\\Gamma$ provided the error distribution $\\chi$ is **automorphically closed**, i.e., $\\tau_{e_j}(\\chi) = \\chi$ for all $e_j$.$$$$\n",
    "**Proof**: Since $\\tau_{e_j}$ is a permutation on elements of $\\mathcal{O}_q$ and $a(X)$ is uniformly distributed, $\\tau_{e_j}(a)$ is uniformly distributed. Since $b(X) = s(X)a(X) + e(X)$, $\\tau_{e_j}(b) = \\tau_{e_j}(s\\cdot a +e) = \\tau_{e_j}(s)\\cdot\\tau_{e_j}(a) + \\tau_{e_j}(e)$. Since $a(X)$ is uniformly distributed, $\\tau_{e_j}(s)\\cdot\\tau_{e_j}(a)$ is also uniformly distributed, even if $s(X)$ might have been drawn from worst-case distribution. (If you find this argument unconvincing, then note that Ring-LWE also has random self reducibility (RSR), so one can translate the whole problem to a uniformly distributed $s(X)$ and run it through RSR.) Also, by assumption, $e(X)$ is drawn from automorphically closed distribution, therefore  $\\tau_{e_j}(s)\\cdot\\tau_{e_j}(a) + \\tau_{e_j}$ is distributed identially as $s(X)\\cdot a(X) + b(X)$.\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "To find all the secrets, let $k$ be the index for which we can compute $\\hat{s}_k$. Since the CRT representation is fixed, this means $\\hat{s}_k$ corresponds to $u^{e_k}$ primitive root of unity. Therefore, to compute all the other roots, let $t_i = e_ie_k^{-1}$, then $(\\tau_{t_i}(a), \\tau_{t_i}(b))$ will return $i$-th CRT coordinate."
